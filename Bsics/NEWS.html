    <p>LIVE India vs Netherlands, ICC World Cup 2023 Warm Up Match Highlights: Rohit Sharma led Indian side was all set to  square off against the Netherlands at the Greenfield stadium in Thiruvananthapuram today. <br>India looked to provide ample of opportunities to all the players during the second warm-up match while cementing their playing XI ahead of their ICC World Cup 2023 opening game against Australia on October 8. <br>

        India is coming off a recent series win against five-time world champions Australia, giving them a lot of confidence<br> going into the all-important World Cup which is returning to India after a gap of 12 years. 
        
        Netherlands, on the other hand, had faced Australia in their first warm-up match at the same venue on September 30 in a <br>game marred by rain. While no result could be obtained, Australia scored 166 for the loss of 3 wickets in their 23 overs while Netherlands could score only 84 runs and lost 6 wickets before the match was eventually called off.<br>
        
        According to a Cricbuzz report, former Indian skipper Virat Kohli did not join the Indian squad on the flight form from <br>Guwahati to Thiruvananthapuram and instead flew to Mumbai owing to a ‘personal emergency’.
        
        The outlet reported that other members of the Indian contingent arrived on Sunday evening for the match against the Netherlands <br>on October 3.
        
        Like the last match between the two sides, rain played a significant role in this warm-up match. Thiruvananthapuram is also the venue<br> where the most warm-up matches (2) for the ICC World Cup 2023 have been called off owing to rains. <br>
        
        After the toss was delayed due to rain, the today's match is called off. This is the third warm-up match in Thiruvananthapuram to be called off due to rain.
