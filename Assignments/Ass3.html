    <p>The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
        So the bar is where I go 
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
        you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
        Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
        And now I’m singing like
        
        Girl you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        Come on now follow my lead
        I may be crazy don’t mind me 
        Say boy let’s not talk too much 
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me
        Come on now follow my lead
        Come come on now follow my lead
        
        I’m in love with the shape of you
        We push and pull like a magnet do
        Although my heart is falling too
        I’m in love with your body
        Last night you were in my room 
        And now my bed sheets smell like you 
        Every day discovering something brand new
        I’m in love with your body
        
        Oh I X 4
        I’m in love with your body
        Oh I X 4
        I’m in love with your body
        Oh I X 4
        I’m in love with your body
        Every day discovering something brand new
        I’m in love with the shape of you 
        
        One week in we let the story begin
        We’re going out on our first date
        You and me are thrifty
        So go all you can eat 
        Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
        We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
        And how your family’s doing ok
        leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
        Tell the driver make the radio play
        and I'm singing like
        
        Girl you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        Come on now follow my lead 
        I may be crazy, don’t mind me
        Say boy let’s not talk too much 
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me
        Come on now follow my lead
        Come come on now follow my lead
        
        I’m in love with the shape of you
